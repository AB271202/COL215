# Assignments for the course COL215

## Digital Logic and System Design

This repository contains the assigments for the course COL215 at IIT Delhi. There were six assignments divided into two categories-hardware and software.

In the software assignments, we sequentially built a program for minimizing boolean functions.

In the hardware assignments, we learnt how to use the seven segment dispaly on the Basys3 board and used it to build a stopwatch (Assignment 2) and a matrix multiplier(Assignment 3).
